### Exercise 1
*Is the PRAM a NUMA or UMA model? Is the PRAM a SIMD or a MIMD model? Does the SPMD characterization apply to the PRAM? Anticipating the programming frameworks to come, what can the advantages of adhering to an SPMD style possibly be? Anticipating even further, is the PRAM a PGAS model?*

1. PRAM is a mostly theoretical model that is defined to use a single global memory. Also, it is not modelled in any way that access times in PRAMs differ: They are simply assumed to always take the same time. These facts given, PRAM is an UMA model. [1]
2. The PRAM code we were presented, or more precisely its par-construct, always split the data into p parts for p processor. These processors operated in
